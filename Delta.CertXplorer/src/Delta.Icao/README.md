Readme
======

This is the readme for **Delta.Icao**, a library aimed at handling anything related
ICAO's Machine Readable Travel Documents and especially e-Passports.

In its current state, the library can decode DG1 data from a regular PC file. It is, of course, 
expected that this will later allow decoding of any e-Passport directly from a smart card reader 
(thanks to **Delta.CapiNet** which provides ASN.1 decoding logic and **Delta.SmartCard** that will 
allow reading from smart card chips).
