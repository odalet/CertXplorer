Readme
======

This is the readme for **Delta.SmartCard**, a library aimed at allowing to read smart card
from PC/SC readers as well as providing useful tools for smart cards handling.

By now it is nothing more but a very thin wrapper around **[Daniel Mueller's excellent pcsc-sharp library](https://github.com/danm-de/pcsc-sharp)**.
